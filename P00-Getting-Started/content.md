> **This Playground (and the recursion playground) is a bit unstable on some computers. If it does not work on yours, please stop and use the next tutorial (no playground version)!**

Now that we've learned _variables_, let's move on to _functions_. In this _Swift Playground_, you will learn how to group code into reusable blocks called _functions_.
